# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, the maintainers and contributors of **multilang-python**, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. Our goal is to create an inclusive environment where all contributors can collaborate to make programming accessible to non-English-speaking communities through our transpileur, which enables Python coding in native languages.

## Our Standards

- **Be Professional**: Maintain a professional tone in discussions, issues, pull requests, and other interactions.
- **Be Supportive**: Help newcomers and guide them through the contribution process (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:
- Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory comments based on personal characteristics.
- Trolling, insulting remarks, or personal attacks.
- Public or private harassment, including unwanted messages or attention.

- Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
